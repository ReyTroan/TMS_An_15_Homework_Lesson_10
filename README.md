In the folder "lesson10" there are two files with homework on the topic "String processing"

In the first part in the folder "part1" it was necessary:

        - Display the first two blocks of 4 digits on the screen in one line.

        - Display the document number on the screen, but replace the blocks of three letters with "***".

	- Display only one letter from the document number in the format yyy/yyy/y/y in lowercase.

	- Display the letters from the document number in the format "Letters:yyy/yyy/y/y"
          in uppercase (implemented using the StringBuilder class).

	- Check whether the document number contains the sequence "abc" and output the message 
	  contains or not.

	- Check whether the document number starts with the sequence "555".

	- Check whether the document number ends with the sequence "1a2b"

In the second part in the "part2" folder:

A string with arbitrary words is fed to the input of the method.

        -Find the shortest word in the string and display it on the screen.
      
        -Find the longest word in the string and display it on the screen.
         If there are several such words, then print the last of them.
      
        -An arbitrary string is given. Output a new line to the console, which duplicates each letter from
         the initial line.
